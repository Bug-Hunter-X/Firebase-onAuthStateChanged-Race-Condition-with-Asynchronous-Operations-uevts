# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener with asynchronous operations.  Rapid authentication state changes (e.g., due to sign-in/sign-out or account switching) can lead to unexpected behavior if asynchronous tasks are not properly handled.

## Problem

The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of operations within the `onAuthStateChanged` callback. If the authentication state changes before an asynchronous operation completes, the listener might trigger again with outdated user information. This can result in data inconsistencies or errors.

## Solution

The provided solution utilizes a mechanism to prevent multiple asynchronous operations from running concurrently.  This ensures that only the most recent authentication state is processed, resolving the race condition. The solution also uses promises to manage asynchronous operations more effectively.
